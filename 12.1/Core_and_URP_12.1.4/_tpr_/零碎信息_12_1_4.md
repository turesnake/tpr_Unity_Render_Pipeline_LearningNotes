#   depth priming
This property determines when Unity performs depth priming.
Depth Priming can improve GPU frame timings by reducing the number of pixel shader executions. 

The performance improvement depends on the amount of overlapping pixels in the opaque pass and the complexity of the pixel shaders that Unity can skip by using depth priming.


The feature has an upfront memory and performance cost. The feature uses a depth prepass to determine which pixel shader invocations Unity can skip, and the feature adds the depth prepass if it's not available yet.


The options are:
• Disabled: Unity does not perform depth priming.
• Auto: If there is a Render Pass that requires a depth prepass, Unity performs the depth prepass and depth priming.
• Forced: Unity always performs depth priming. To do this, Unity also performs a depth prepass for every render pass. NOTE: depth priming is disabled at runtime on certain hardware (Tile Based Deferred Rendering) regardless of this setting.

On Android, iOS, and Apple TV, Unity performs depth priming only in the Forced mode. On tiled GPUs, which are common to those platforms, depth priming might reduce performance when combined with MSAA.
